  "description": "Passionate about new technologies, I started exploring programming at the age of 11 with an Arduino board. Self-taught and always on the lookout for innovations, I developed extracurricular projects and learned to program in Python. Constantly seeking challenges, I'm not afraid to step out of my comfort zone to improve myself and work on my weaknesses."
